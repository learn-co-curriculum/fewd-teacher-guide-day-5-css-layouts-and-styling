## Objectives

* Students will learn a deeper understanding of CSS
* Students will have a chance to review and solidify what was learned in the previous class

### Key Student Take-Aways

* Students will have a deeper understanding of the different ways to style using CSS
* Students will strengthen their existing knowledge through repetition of CSS block creation

### Caveats

* CSS has a large number of properties, and it should be clearly noted to students that it isn't expected that they memorize or even fully explore all of the properties.  Instead of strict memorization, students should feel okay using reference materials for as long as they need, as this is something that even professional web designers will do.  The emphasis should be on the _design_ aspect, not memorization or total comprehension.
